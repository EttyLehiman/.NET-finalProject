* **To-Do Management:**
    * Users can add, update, and delete their own to-do items.
    * To-do items include details like description and location (optional).

## Technical Details

* Persistent Storage: JSON files (temporary, consider database integration)
* Dependency Injection: Facilitates switching to database storage in the future
* Logging: Records request details (start time, controller/action, user, duration)

## Client Notes

* Default page displays user's to-do list (add, update, delete options).
* Login page displayed if no token or expired token.
* Admin users have a link to manage users.
* Login page includes a Postman button for testing API endpoints.

## Challenges (Optional)

* User details update (name, password)
* Admin to-do management as a regular user
* Google account login integration
